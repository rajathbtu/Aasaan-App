# Razorpay Payment Integration - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Implemented

### Backend Implementation (/backend)

1. **Razorpay SDK Integration**

2. **Payment Controller Enhancements**
   - Added new endpoints for Razorpay payment flow:
     - `POST /payments/create-boost-order` - Create order for boosting work requests
     - `POST /payments/verify-boost-payment` - Verify boost payment
     - `POST /payments/create-subscription-order` - Create order for subscriptions
     - `POST /payments/verify-subscription-payment` - Verify subscription payment
   - Maintained backward compatibility with credit-based payments

3. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `Payment` model to track all payment transactions
   - Added payment status and type enums
   - Created database migration for payment tracking

4. **Security Features**
   - HMAC SHA256 signature verification for all payments
   - Server-side payment validation with Razorpay API
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

5. **Internationalization**
   - Added payment error messages in multiple languages
   - Enhanced user feedback for payment failures

### Frontend Implementation (/frontend)

1. **Razorpay SDK Integration**
   - Installed `react-native-razorpay` package
   - Created TypeScript definitions for Razorpay
   - Built payment service layer in `src/api/razorpay.ts`

2. **Enhanced Payment Screens**
   - **BoostRequestScreen**: Added Razorpay payment option alongside credit payments
   - **SubscriptionScreen**: Integrated secure payment flow for plan upgrades
   - Maintained dual payment options (Razorpay + Credits) for user convenience

3. **Error Handling & UX**
   - Comprehensive error handling for all Razorpay error codes
   - User-friendly error messages with retry options
   - Loading states and payment confirmation flows

4. **Payment Utilities**
   - Created `src/utils/paymentUtils.ts` for payment processing helpers
   - Amount formatting and validation functions
   - Payment error mapping and alert systems

5. **Type Safety**
   - Complete TypeScript definitions for Razorpay integration
   - Type-safe payment request/response interfaces
   - Enhanced API type definitions

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Razorpay credentials:
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret_here

# The database schema has been updated
# Generate Prisma client if needed
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Razorpay public key:
EXPO_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
```

### 3. Razorpay Account Setup

1. **Create Account**: Sign up at https://razorpay.com
2. **Get API Keys**: 
   - Go to Dashboard > Settings > API Keys
   - Generate test keys for development
   - Generate live keys for production

3. **Configure Webhooks** (Optional but Recommended):
   - Go to Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL: `https://yourbackend.com/webhooks/razorpay`
   - Select events: payment.captured, payment.failed, order.paid

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Payment Flow for Boost Requests

1. User selects "Pay with Money" on BoostRequestScreen
2. Frontend calls backend to create Razorpay order
3. Backend creates order with Razorpay and returns order details
4. Frontend opens Razorpay payment gateway
5. User completes payment with card/UPI/wallet
6. Razorpay returns payment response to frontend
7. Frontend sends payment details to backend for verification
8. Backend verifies signature and payment status with Razorpay
9. Backend updates work request as "boosted"
10. User sees success confirmation

### Payment Flow for Subscriptions

Similar flow but for subscription plans (Basic/Pro) with different amounts and endpoints.

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

1. **Signature Verification**: All payments verified using HMAC SHA256
2. **Server-Side Validation**: Double-checking payment status with Razorpay API
3. **Environment Protection**: API secrets never exposed to frontend
4. **Payment Records**: All transactions logged in database
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents payment fraud

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Cards for Development

- **Success**: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- **Failure**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Authentication**: 4000 0000 0000 3220

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Boost Payment**:
   - Create work request as end user
   - Navigate to request details â†’ Boost Request
   - Select "Pay with Money" â†’ Complete payment
   - Verify request shows as boosted

2. **Test Subscription Payment**:
   - Switch to service provider role
   - Go to Profile â†’ Subscription
   - Select plan â†’ Pay with Money â†’ Complete payment
   - Verify plan updated in profile

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### For End Users (Boost Requests)
- Simple two-option payment: Credits or Money
- Secure Razorpay gateway with multiple payment methods
- Real-time payment status updates
- Clear success/failure messaging

### For Service Providers (Subscriptions)
- Easy plan comparison and selection
- Flexible payment options (Credits or Money)
- Instant plan activation after payment
- Clear benefit explanations

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

- All existing credit-based payments continue to work
- Users can choose between Razorpay and credits
- Existing API endpoints remain functional
- No breaking changes to current functionality

## ðŸ“Š What's Tracked

- All payment attempts and outcomes
- Payment method preferences
- Error patterns and retry behavior
- Revenue analytics ready data structure

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Security**: Never commit API secrets to version control
2. **Testing**: Always test with Razorpay test environment first
3. **Production**: Switch to live keys only when ready for real payments
4. **Monitoring**: Set up payment failure alerts for production
5. **Compliance**: Ensure PCI compliance if storing any payment data
